- Respect `dot_notation` flag in ignore argument (@yoyonel) (#107)
- Adds argument for toggling dot notation in diff. (@robinchew)

Version 0.7.2 (released 2019-02-22)

- Two NaN values are considered the same, hence they are not shown in `diff`
  output.  (#114) (@t-b)

  (@yoyonel)
- Python porting best practice use feature detection instead
  of version detection to save an import and pass both PyLint
  and Flake8 tests with neither 'pragma' nor 'noqa'.  (@cclauss)

Version 0.7.1 (released 2018-05-04)

- Resolves issue with keys containing dots.  (#101)

Version 0.7.0 (released 2017-10-16)

- Adds new option for patching and reverting patches in-place.
- Adds Python 3.6 to test matrix.
- Fixes the `ignore` argument when it contains a unicode value.

  `swap` is called so the list items are removed from the end. (#85)

  (#79)
- Executes doctests during PyTest invocation.

Version 0.6.0 (released 2016-06-22)

- Adds support for comparing NumPy arrays.  (#68)
- Adds support for comparing mutable mappings, sequences and sets from

- Fixes order in which handled conflicts are unified so that the
  Merger's unified_patches can be always applied.

Version 0.5.0 (released 2016-01-04)

- Adds tolerance parameter used when user wants to treat closed values
  as equals
- Adds support for comparing numerical values and NaN. (#54) (#55)
